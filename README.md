# Ragnar Revival

A ZX Spectrum 48K 3D isometric game originally developed in the 1980s in Z80 assembly language.

## About This Project

Ragnar Revival was originally developed as a 3D isometric demo for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K. The demo showcased an 8x8 block rendering system with 2 layers, written entirely in Z80 assembly language.

### Historical Context

This project represents early experiments with 3D isometric graphics on the ZX Spectrum, pushing the boundaries of what was possible on a home computer with just 48KB of memory.

## Repository Contents

- `Ragnar (demo).z80` - Original ZX Spectrum snapshot file containing the demo

## Future Development Plans

- Complete the original Ragnar Revival game concept
- Implement the enhanced 8-layer block engine
- Potentially create a machine code version of Sword of Fargoal with procedurally generated maps
- Explore 3D isometric game mechanics

## Development Setup

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions on setting up a modern development environment for ZX Spectrum Z80 assembly programming.

## Running the Demo

1. Download a ZX Spectrum emulator (see recommendations in DEVELOPMENT.md)
2. Open `Ragnar (demo).z80` in the emulator
3. The demo should start automatically
